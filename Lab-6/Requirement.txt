Dear Students
This lab assignment requires the implementation of Filters 
through GUI where the user will choose the filter of his choice
 from the given options.

Develop your own algorithm based on, what is given for 3 by 3 Simple average.

Do not use existing libraries for just calling functions that implement Filters.

You are required to submit the implementation of the following 3 by 3 Filters. 5 marks each

1-Simple Average -- #method start 4-23
2-Weighted Average
3-Median Filter
4-Min/Max Filter
5-Laplacian Filter
6-Sobel Filter
7-Prewitt Filter
8-Robert Filter

You will also implement, a Generalised Simple Average where user will
choose the size of filter, such as 3by3 or 5by5
or 7by7 etc...any odd numbered. 10 marks

Submission:
*.py file
screenshot of the input image, Filter Code, and output Image.
Anything else, you think is required to execute the code?
